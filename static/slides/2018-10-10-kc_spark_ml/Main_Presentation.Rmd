## Introduction

Who is this woman? 

Why should I listen to her?

## Overview

- What I will talk about.
- What I will not talk about.
- Why do we need two frameworks for ML in Spark?

# Spark ML

## Overview of the Spark ML

- History
- Languages: Java, Scala, Python, & R.
- Algorithms: See handout.

## Pros of the Spark ML

- Fair allocation of resources with YARN.
- Broad Variety of Algorithms.
- Good documentation for Scala, Java, & Python.

## Cons of the Spark ML

- Documentation and examples for R are limited (see spark.Rstudio.com for documentation.)
- Must convert data to parquet format before running models.
- Errors are very cryptic.

## Spark MLlib Documentation

Documentation on models as well as Scala, Java, & Python code can be found here: <https://spark.apache.org/mllib/>

Documentation for R code is here: http://spark.rstudio.com/

# H2O.ai Sparkling Water

## Overview of H2O.ai Sparkling Water

- History (do you remember 0xdata?)
- Interfaces: Scala, R, Python, & H2O Flow UI.
- Algorthims: See handout.

## Pros of H2O.ai Sparkling Water

- Code and UI similar for base H2O.ai product
- Runs faster due to non-dynamic memory allocation for YARN que in Spark
- Output is more Statistican Friendly.
- Performing a Parameter Search is more user friendly.

## Cons of H2O.ai Sparkling Water

- Interfacing with Spark causes bugs
- Must convert you data to the H2O format for use.

# Suggestions 

## Spark ML might be for you if...

- You ONLY work with ALL the data.
- You like Machine Learning Pipelines.
- You like debugging cryptic error codes.

## H2O.ai Sparkling Water might be for you if...

- You code in base R.
- You like a point and click interface (Flow UI).
- You are a Statistician.
- You want to use XGBoost in Spark.
- You like scaling up problems.
- You like debugging error codes that make sense to a human.
